# Assignment 1
## Domains
1. ***Swimming**: tracking workouts, meet schedule, recovery*
2. ***Travel**: planning trips and keeping track of itineraries*
3. ***Movies**: deciding what to watch and where to watch it*
4. ***Tracking sports teams** following games, scores, team/player stats, and player updates*
- I follow teams across multiple leagues and cities, including the Ravens and Eagles (NFL), Phillies (MLB), and occasionally the Sixers and Flyers. Also, as a swimmer, I like to know general news about the sport and major meets. I enjoy tracking stats, watching games, and staying up to date on scores, news, and player updates. I currently use a mix of apps to do so.
5. ***Staying focused on a task**: managing distractions to stay productive*
6. ***Music/Concerts**: finding shows, buying tickets, tracking artists, finding friends to go with*
7. ***Food**: discovering new restaurants, logging/reviewing ones I've tried*
8. ***Finding cafés**: locating good work spots with Wi-Fi, outlets, seating, and various noise/busyness levels*
- When I first came to MIT, I quickly came to appreciate laptop-friendly cafés where I could work, grab a coffee, and study comfortably. In Boston, most cafés are accommodating, but while abroad this summer I struggled to find good spots when I wasn’t in the office or when I was traveling. Since my apartment didn’t have a workspace, I often wished for an easy way to discover places where I could reliably work, take calls, and have internet access in a new city.
9. ***Internship/career application tracking**: organizing applications, deadlines, follow-ups, next steps*
10. ***Building new skills**: setting goals, finding resources, and tracking progress in skills (languages, chess, etc.)*
- I enjoy building new skills, from chess and Dutch to coding, guitar, and sports. I usually set goals across these areas, but when things get busy they often fall to the wayside. It’s not that they become less important. Rather, I just forget about them, lose track of the resources I rely on, or don’t keep up with the different apps I use to improve

## Problems
### Tracking sports
1. ***Multiple apps to follow:** NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, ESPN, Bleacher Report… following different teams means going through multiple apps and websites just to see basic stats and schedules*
2. ***Information overload:** Existing apps flood you with articles, ads, and rumors, making it hard to quickly find just scores, schedules, and key stats*
3. ***Limited customization:** Most apps restrict you to one favorite league, team, or city, making it difficult for cross-league or cross-city fans (ex. following both the Eagles and Ravens) to track everything in one place*

### Finding cafés
1. ***Unreliable information**: Google Maps/Beli/Yelp give ratings but rarely give reliable information about rules about laptops, wifi, outlets, etc.*
2. ***Hard to find on the go**: When traveling or in a new citym it's hard to quickly find good working spots nearby*
3. ***Inconsistent environments/needs**: Sometimes I want quiet, sometimes a lively atmosphere; sometimes a long stay, other times just a short stop. Current apps/tools I use don’t help filter cafés by these changing needs*

### Building/tracking new skills
1. ***Fragmented resources**: Each skill (chess, Dutch, coding, guitar) requires a different app or site, making it hard to keep track of goals in one place*
2. ***Lack of tailored reminders**: Apps like Duolingo send alerts, but for other skills (like guitar or chess) I often need simple nudges to practice that day to stay engaged with my goals.*
3. ***No progress overview**: Because tracking varies by app or task, it’s difficult to see overall progress, making it easier to lose momentum and forget how far I’ve come.*

## Selected and Unselected Problems
### Three Selected Problems
1. **Sports: Multiple apps to follow**
- I follow teams across different leagues and cities, but keeping track of them requires juggling multiple apps. Even for basic stats and schedules, I have to switch back and forth between platforms. This problem is worth pursuing because it’s frequent, widespread among multi-sport fans, and makes the experience more frustrating and time-consuming than it should be. Solving it would also help reduce information overload and improve customization.

2. **Finding cafés: Hard to find on the go**
- When I’m traveling or in a new city, I often need to quickly find a place to work. Even if some cafés have the right information listed online, the process of searching through reviews, scanning multiple apps, or walking around wastes valuable time. The problem isn’t just missing details, but rather it’s the lack of a fast, streamlined way to discover work-friendly cafés nearby when I need one. This problem is worth pursuing because it happens in urgent, real-world situations (calls, deadlines, meetings), and I'm unaware of an existing tool that makes this process efficient.

3. **Sports: Information Overload**
- When I check sports apps, I’m often flooded with articles, ads, and rumors when all I really want are scores, schedules, and key stats. The piles of information are helpful for some (like fantasy players), but for daily tracking, not so much. The extra noise makes it harder and more time-consuming to find the basics I care about. This problem is worth pursuing because nearly every sports fan experiences it, and a solution focused on clarity and minimalism would create real value.

### Three Unselected Problems
1. **Finding cafés: Unreliable Information**
- Getting consistent information reliably would require either every café to input it or large numbers of users to contribute reviews across many locations, which is difficult to achieve. I chose not to pursue this one because it is a narrower version of the bigger “hard to find on the go” problem, and even if solved, it would face major feasibility challenges.

2. **Building/tracking Skills: Lack of tailored reminders**
- I chose not to pursue this because it doesn’t feel different enough from existing solutions. People could just set a recurring reminder on their phone instead of needing a dedicated app. Also, having to input all your skills/goals could be too much of an inconvenience for what the solution would offer.

3. **Building/tracking Skills: No progress overview**
- I chose not to pursue this one because it would be technically challenging to integrate progress from so many domains, and even if solved, it may not provide enough daily value compared to other problems. In addition, “progress” would mean very different things depending on the skill, making it difficult to design a consistent system.

## Stakeholders
### **Sports: Multiple apps to follow**
- **Multi-sport fans:** people who follow teams across leagues and cities
- **Sports media companies:** organizations currently producing apps specific to updates about certain sports/domains
- **Fantasy/Betting platforms:** DraftKings, FanDuel, etc. who rely on users being able to track scores/stats efficiently across sports
> **Impact**: Multi-sport fans waste time juggling several apps to stay updated, which creates frustration and makes following their teams less enjoyable. Sports media companies might lose direct app engagement, but their content could be used as a primary source within a streamlined tool, so they would still influence how information is delivered. Fantasy and betting platforms depend on timely, cross-sport information, and fragmentation makes it harder for their users to track results efficiently.
### **Finding cafés: Hard to find on the go**
- **Travelers/Commuters:** people in unfamiliar cities or moving between locations who need a reliable spot quickly for work, calls, or breaks
- **Café workers/owners:** businesses and staff whose customer base may increase or decrease depending on how easily their café is found as laptop-friendly
- **Remote workers/students:** people who regularly depend on cafés as secondary workspaces outside of offices, coworking spaces, or dorms
> **Impact:** Travelers and commuters often waste valuable time searching for a reliable spot, which can lead to missed calls, late starts on work, or general frustration. Remote workers and students lose productivity when they can’t easily find cafés that fit their needs, especially when moving between neighborhoods or cities. Café workers and owners are also affected: being recognized as laptop-friendly could attract more customers, but it isn’t always good for business if long stays and limited turnover reduce sales.
### **Sports: Information Overload**
- **Everyday Fans:** people who mainly want schedules, scores, and key stats to keep a general idea of how their teams or favorite players are doing
- **Sports media companies/advertisers:** organizations that push more content and ads to maximize engagement and revenue
- **Fantasy players/analytics fans:** people who benefit from and enjoy large amounts of stats, articles, and analysis
> **Impact:** Everyday fans get frustrated by cluttered apps, spending more time than necessary to find basic information. Fantasy players and analytics-driven fans may value the extra content, so a streamlined solution risks underserving them. Sports media companies and advertisers benefit from the current model, since articles and ads drive clicks and revenue, but they might lose visibility if fans migrate to a cleaner, minimal alternative.

## Features
### **Sports: Multiple apps to follow**
1. **Unified Dashboard to Track Favorite Teams**: A single interface where fans can see scores, schedules, and stats for all their favorite teams across leagues. This directly helps multi-sport fans by cutting down the need to juggle NFL, NBA, MLB, etc. apps, and simplifies engagement for casual fans who just want the essentials.
2. **Customizable Favorites Feed**: Fans select specific teams, players, or even stat categories, creating a tailored feed. This reduces noise and helps fantasy/betting platforms as well, since users can prioritize data most relevant to their decisions.
3. **Cross-App Aggregation Tools**: A feature that pulls together scores and updates from multiple official league/team apps into one central feed, even if those apps remain separate. Instead of bouncing between the NFL, NBA, or MLB apps, a multi-sport fan could see them consolidated in one place but still from their trusted sources. This reduces fragmentation without requiring every league to abandon its own ecosystem.


### **Finding cafés: Hard to find on the go**
1. **Amenity-Based Filtering**: A search feature where users can filter cafés by criteria like Wi-Fi reliability, number of outlets, noise level, or time limits. This helps travelers and remote workers quickly find a spot that fits their immediate needs without relying on trial and error. Data could come from a combination of verified café input and scraping recent online reviews for consistency.
2. **Verified Café Profiles**: Cafés can create or claim profiles that list work-friendly amenities such as Wi-Fi quality, outlet availability, and time-limit policies. This reduces reliance on crowdsourced reviews and gives café owners control over how they present their space, while providing remote workers with more reliable, standardized information. Scraping from official café websites could help keep information up to date even if owners aren’t active on the platform.
3. **Fair-Use Transparency Toolss**: Profiles highlight policies like time limits, purchase minimums, or designated laptop zones. This helps remote workers and students avoid surprises and lets café owners set clear expectations, easing tension between long-stay laptop users and businesses. Combining café input with aggregated online reviews ensures transparency reflects both official policies and actual customer experiences.

### **Sports: Information Overload**
1. **Clean, Ad-Lite Experiences**: A focus on lightweight design with limited ads or intrusive media. This improves usability for fans who often feel overwhelmed, and reduces the "information scatter" that frustrates them
2. **Additive dashboard design**: Instead of starting with a cluttered interface and filtering things out, fans begin with a simple, empty dashboard and add only the teams, stats, or players they care about. This ensures the app grows with their interests and prevents overload from the start.
3. **Smart Notification Controlss**: Fans can choose exactly what kinds of alerts they want (final scores, major plays, or only breaking news). This prevents alert fatigue while still keeping fantasy players and hardcore fans informed when they want deeper, more frequent updates.
